name: grilling
description: Interview the user relentlessly about a plan, decision, or idea. Use when intent is vague, underspecified, or the user wants to stress-test their thinking.

Grill **round by round**, not one at a time. Map the decision tree; each round, ask the whole **frontier** — every question whose prerequisites are settled — as one numbered list with a recommended answer each. Recompute from answers, repeat. Same tree, same order, fewer turns.

Format each round:

```
❓ **Q1 - <title>**: <question body — paragraphs or choices as needed>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Finding *facts* is your job, never the user's. If a fact is code-answerable, look it up instead of asking (code, tools, web search); dispatch a subagent for heavier exploration. Don't block the frontier on a running exploration — only the questions downstream of it wait; ask the rest now. The *decisions* are the user's: put each to them and wait.

Grill toward the essential/accidental split (Brooks): is each requirement solving the actual problem, or baggage layered on top? "Essential" is a hypothesis to pressure-test, not a verdict — a re-frame may reveal it as accidental in disguise. Apply the same test to the proposed solution shape — the deletion pass at plan time: for each component or abstraction in the plan, ask which requirement dies if it's cut, and cut orphans before they're written — then trim the survivors to the minimum sufficient, not the most complete.

## Existence grilling

When the subject would produce change — a ticket, a plan, an inline ask — the session opens by grilling the item's right to exist, before anything inside it. Pure design or review subjects that produce no change skip this.

Pre-fetch the evidence before asking:

1. The problem restated in one sentence — what breaks without this?
2. The demand source — incident, asker, PM, measurable debt?
3. The cost of doing nothing for a quarter.
4. The cheaper 80/20, if one exists.
5. The **mootness check**: is the item already done, duplicated, or superseded? Tickets — its resolution, a text-search of the tracker for likely twins, its link graph. Inline asks — does the repo already do it, is someone already on it?

Then open round 1 with the existence question, the evidence, and a recommended verdict: **proceed** (restating the why), **descope**, **defer**, or **kill**. The verdict is the user's; requirement and solution-shape grilling proceed only on proceed or descope. On kill or defer, propose closing or de-prioritising the item where it lives; on descope, propose trimming its source; execute any write-back only on the user's yes.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act until the user confirms shared understanding.
